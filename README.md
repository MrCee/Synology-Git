To quicky get Git up and running ASAP without using the Synology DSM Package Manager you can tung the following:

```
curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MrCee/Synology-Git/refs/heads/main/install-synology-git.sh | bash
```

This will install the SynnoCommunity Package of Git and allow cloning of new projects.

This version is outdated, althout it will get the job done and if you are updating to Synology-Homebrew, it will be replaced by the latest version.
